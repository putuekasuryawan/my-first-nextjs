# My First Next.js

Hi there! 👋  
This is my very first project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).  
Inside, you'll find:

- Step-by-step notes of how I installed and set up the project
- What I learned during the setup process
- A simple starting page to test everything

This is just a simple documentation of my first steps with Next.js — hope it helps someone starting out too.

🛠️ Step 1: Getting Ready

Before jumping into Next.js, I found out that I needed to install Node.js first — it’s basically what makes everything run in the background.

I went to nodejs.org and downloaded the LTS version (figured it's safer and more stable for a beginner like me 😅).

After installing, I opened up my terminal and typed:
![node and npm version](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4de86950-c010-4d95-88af-faa675f4496c)

The version numbers popped up (mine was around v20.x.x), which was a good sign that things were working. Small win, but it felt great to see it work!
