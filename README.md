# My First Next.js

Hi there! 👋  
This is my very first project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).  
Inside, you'll find:

- Step-by-step notes of how I installed and set up the project
- What I learned during the setup process
- A simple starting page to test everything

This is just a simple documentation of my first steps with Next.js — hope it helps someone starting out too.

🛠️ Step 1: Getting Ready

Before jumping into Next.js, I found out that I needed to install Node.js first — it’s basically what makes everything run in the background.

I went to nodejs.org and downloaded the LTS version (figured it's safer and more stable for a beginner like me 😅).

After installing, I opened up my terminal and typed:
![node and npm version](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4de86950-c010-4d95-88af-faa675f4496c)

The version numbers popped up, which was a good sign that things were working. Small win, but it felt great to see it work!

🚧 Step 2: Creating the Project

Once Node.js was set up, I went ahead and tried creating my first Next.js project. I used the following command in the terminal, npx create-next-app@latest:



It asked me a few questions, and here's how I answered:

Project name: my-first-nextjs

TypeScript: I picked No (keeping it simple for now)

ESLint: Yes

Tailwind CSS: Yes, because I’ve been meaning to try it

Use src/ directory: Yes

App Router: Yes (seems to be the new standard in Next.js)

After that, it generated a full project folder named my-first-nextjs with everything set up.
