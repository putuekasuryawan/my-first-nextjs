# My First Next.js

Hi there! 👋  
This is my very first project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).  
Inside, you'll find:

- Step-by-step notes of how I installed and set up the project
- What I learned during the setup process
- A simple starting page to test everything

This is just a simple documentation of my first steps with Next.js — hope it helps someone starting out too.

🛠️ Step 1: Getting Ready

Before jumping into Next.js, I found out that I needed to install Node.js first — it’s basically what makes everything run in the background.

I went to nodejs.org and downloaded the LTS version (figured it's safer and more stable for a beginner like me 😅).

After installing, I opened up my terminal and typed:
![node and npm version](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4de86950-c010-4d95-88af-faa675f4496c)

The version numbers popped up, which was a good sign that things were working. Small win, but it felt great to see it work!

🚧 Step 2: Creating the Project

Once Node.js was set up, first, I navigated to the folder where I usually keep all my personal projects, in this case C:\Users\Eka Suryawan\Documents\PROJECT\NEXTJS, then I used the following command in the terminal, npx create-next-app@latest
![create nextjs app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cfe1b69-d9a5-4a02-9816-736945578ce4)

I wasn’t sure what to expect, but the CLI walked me through a few questions. After answering those, it generated everything in a nice folder — surprisingly quick.


⚡ Step 3: Running the Project

After creating the project and jumping into the my-first-nextjs folder, I made a few tweaks to the default files — mainly layout.js and page.js — just to try and make it feel more like my project 😅
Then, I ran this prompt:
```bash
npm run dev
```
That kicked off the development server, and it gave me a URL — http://localhost:3000

I opened that link in my browser, and voila... 🎉 the page loaded!
It showed my customized version of the welcome screen, with the changes I made showing up right away. That was the moment it really felt like something was working.

🏁 Final Project Output

This is the final result of the project:
